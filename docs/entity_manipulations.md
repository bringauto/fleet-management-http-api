## Car

Entity [description](definitions.md#car).

### Post

Requirements:
- [Platform HW](#platformhw) must exist and must not be used by some other Car.
- [Default route ID](#route) must exist.

Result:
- The Car ID is automatically set by the server.
- A Car is created.
- A [Car State](#car-state) created with the `out_of_order` status.

- All the Clients waiting for some new Car States of a particular [Car](#car) receive a response (for the order state GET method).


## Order

Entity [description](definitions.md#order).

Each order falls into one of the following categories:
- **Inactive** - the order has the last [Order State](#order-state) with status DONE or CANCELED.

- An Order is created.
- An [Order State](#order-state) created with the `to_accept` status.

### Delete

Requirements:
- None

Result:
- The Order is deleted.

- Oldest Order States might be deleted, so the number of states stored by the API for a particular [Order](#order) is not greater than $N_{order\,states}$.
- All the Clients waiting for some new Order States of a particular [Order](#order) receive a response (for the order state GET method).
- If the Order State has a final status (DONE or CANCELED) and the server already stores maximum allowed number of inactive [Orders](#order), the inactive Order with which has been first marked as inactive is deleted.
